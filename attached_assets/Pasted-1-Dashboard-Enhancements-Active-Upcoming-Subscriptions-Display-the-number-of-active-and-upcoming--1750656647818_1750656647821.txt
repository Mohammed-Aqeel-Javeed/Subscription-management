Logic Based on Reminder Policy and Reminder Days (n):

One time – One notification is sent n days before the subscription end date.

Two times – Two notifications:

First at n days before

Second at n/2 days before (rounded down)

Until Renewal – Continuous daily notifications from:

Day n before the end date

Down to the final day of the subscription
